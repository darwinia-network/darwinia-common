//! # Treasury Module
//!
//! The Treasury module provides a "pot" of funds that can be managed by stakeholders in the
//! system and a structure for making spending proposals from this pot.
//!
//! - [`treasury::Trait`](./trait.Trait.html)
//! - [`Call`](./enum.Call.html)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Treasury Module itself provides the pot to store funds, and a means for stakeholders to
//! propose, approve, and deny expenditures. The chain will need to provide a method (e.g.
//! inflation, fees) for collecting funds.
//!
//! By way of example, the Council could vote to fund the Treasury with a portion of the block
//! reward and use the funds to pay developers.
//!
//! ### Tipping
//!
//! A separate subsystem exists to allow for an agile "tipping" process, whereby a reward may be
//! given without first having a pre-determined stakeholder group come to consensus on how much
//! should be paid.
//!
//! A group of `Tippers` is determined through the config `Trait`. After half of these have declared
//! some amount that they believe a particular reported reason deserves, then a countdown period is
//! entered where any remaining members can declare their tip amounts also. After the close of the
//! countdown period, the median of all declared tips is paid to the reported beneficiary, along
//! with any finders fee, in case of a public (and bonded) original report.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Proposal:** A suggestion to allocate funds from the pot to a beneficiary.
//! - **Beneficiary:** An account who will receive the funds from a proposal iff
//! the proposal is approved.
//! - **Deposit:** Funds that a proposer must lock when making a proposal. The
//! deposit will be returned or slashed if the proposal is approved or rejected
//! respectively.
//! - **Pot:** Unspent funds accumulated by the treasury module.
//!
//! Tipping protocol:
//! - **Tipping:** The process of gathering declarations of amounts to tip and taking the median
//!   amount to be transferred from the treasury to a beneficiary account.
//! - **Tip Reason:** The reason for a tip; generally a URL which embodies or explains why a
//!   particular individual (identified by an account ID) is worthy of a recognition by the
//!   treasury.
//! - **Finder:** The original public reporter of some reason for tipping.
//! - **Finders Fee:** Some proportion of the tip amount that is paid to the reporter of the tip,
//!   rather than the main beneficiary.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! General spending/proposal protocol:
//! - `propose_spend` - Make a spending proposal and stake the required deposit.
//! - `set_pot` - Set the spendable balance of funds.
//! - `configure` - Configure the module's proposal requirements.
//! - `reject_proposal` - Reject a proposal, slashing the deposit.
//! - `approve_proposal` - Accept the proposal, returning the deposit.
//!
//! Tipping protocol:
//! - `report_awesome` - Report something worthy of a tip and register for a finders fee.
//! - `retract_tip` - Retract a previous (finders fee registered) report.
//! - `tip_new` - Report an item worthy of a tip and declare a specific amount to tip.
//! - `tip` - Declare or redeclare an amount to tip for a particular reason.
//! - `close_tip` - Close and pay out a tip.
//!
//! ## GenesisConfig
//!
//! The Treasury module depends on the [`GenesisConfig`](./struct.GenesisConfig.html).
